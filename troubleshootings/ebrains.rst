Why cannot I find NEST Simulator?
   Sometimes the issue is resolved when you check NEST Simulator.

   If not, the problem lies in the expired token for the user authentication of the *EBRAINS* platform. This happens in
   a new session when you re-visit the page after the browser is closed.

   A simple solution is to reload the page (:keys:`ctrl+shift+r`) so that you can re-login.

.. warning::
   Please avoid to accidentally delete site data you want to keep! Ensure to export your projects if you want to keep
   them - the save button stores them only in the browser storage!

Why do I receive the message "504 Gateway Time-out"?
   Please have a look at the :ref:`section in the error codes<gateway-time-out>`.
