Live demo
=========

Below, you can find a live demo of NEST Desktop itself (might not work in private mode).
However, you are only able to construct and edit networks, as it does not contain a NEST Server/NEST Simulator instance.
Without the backend, you cannot perform the simulation.
If you want to use the backend as well, please have a look at the `EBRAINS platform <https://nest-desktop.apps.hbp.eu/#/>`__,
where you can use the simulator, too (after a quick and free registration).
