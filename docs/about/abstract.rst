**An educational application for neuroscience**

Simulation software for spiking neuronal network models matured in the past decades
regarding performance and flexibility.
Nevertheless, the entry barrier remains high for students and early career scientists
in computational neuroscience since these simulators typically require programming skills
and a complex installation.
Here, we describe an installation-free graphical user interface (GUI) running
in the web browser, which is distinct from the simulation engine running anywhere, 
on the studentâ€™s laptop or on a supercomputer.

This architecture provides robustness against technological changes in the software stack
and simplifies the deployment for process for students/autodidacts and for teachers.
Our new open source tool, NEST Desktop [#f1]_, comprises graphical elements for creating
and configuring network models, running simulations, as well as for visualizing and analyzing the results.
NEST Desktop allows students to explore important concepts in computational neuroscience
without the need to learn a simulator control language before.

Our experiences so far highlight that NEST Desktop helps advancing both quality
and intensity of teaching in computational neuroscience in regular university courses.
We view the availability of the tool on public resources like the European ICT infrastructure
for neuroscience EBRAINS as a contribution to equal opportunities [#f2]_.

A paper for NEST Desktop is available on `eNeuro <https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/6/ENEURO.0274-21.2021>`__.
