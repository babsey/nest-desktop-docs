Why cannot I find NEST Simulator?
   Sometimes the issue is resolved when you check NEST Simulator.

   If not, the problem lies in the expired token for the user authentication of the *EBRAINS* platform.
   This happens in a new session when you re-visit the page after the browser is closed.

   A simple solution is to reload the page (:guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`SHIFT` + :guilabel:`R`) so that you can re-login.

.. warning::
   Please avoid to accidentally delete site data you want to keep!
   Ensure to export your projects if you want to keep them -
   the save button stores them only in the browser storage!
