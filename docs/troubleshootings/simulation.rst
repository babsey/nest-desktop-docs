Simulation
==========

How can I start a simulation?
   Click on the :bdg:`SIMULATE` button in top right of the page to start the simulation.

How can I stop a simulation?
   Unfortunately, the option to stop simulation is not implemented.

How can I activate "simulation after change"?
   In the menu of the :bdg:`SIMULATE` button (by clicking it on caret at the right side)
   you will find an option to activate :bdg:`simulation after change`.

How can I activate "simulation after load"?
   In the menu of the :bdg:`SIMULATE` button (by clicking it on caret at the right side)
   you will find an option to activate :bdg:`simulation after load`.

How can I activate "simulation after checkout"?
   When you go to another network version of the history, it automatically starts the simulation.
   In the menu of the :bdg:`SIMULATE` button (by clicking it on caret at the right side)
   you will find an option to activate :bdg:`simulation after checkout`.

Where can I find the kernel controller of the simulation?
   The kernel controller can be shown by clicking on the engine icon on the right side.

      - :ref:`Kernel controller <controller-sidebar-kernel-settings>`

Where can I set the simulation time?
   You will find the simulation time in the kernel controller.

   .. seeAlso::
      - :ref:`Change simulation time in the kernel controller <controller-sidebar-kernel-settings>`

Where can I change the time resolution of the kernel?
   You will find the time resolution for the NEST Simulator in the kernel controller.

   .. warning::
      Please verify that the recording interval is equal to
      or larger than the time resolution of the simulation!

      - :ref:`Change time resolution in the kernel controller <controller-sidebar-kernel-settings>`

Where can I change the seed?
   You can find the seed value in the kernel controller.

   .. seeAlso::
      - :ref:`Change seed in the kernel controller <controller-sidebar-kernel-settings>`

How can I activate the seed randomization?
   You can find an option to activate the seed randomization in the kernel controller.

   .. seeAlso::
      - :ref:`Activate seed randomization in the kernel controller <controller-sidebar-kernel-settings>`

How can I find the Python script code of the simulation?
   On the right side you can find a code symbol :bdg:`<\\>` opening the code editor.
