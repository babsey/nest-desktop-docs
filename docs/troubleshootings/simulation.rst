How can I start a simulation?
   Click on the :guilabel:`SIMULATE` button in top right of the page to start the simulation.

How can I stop a simulation?
   Unfortunately, the option to stop simulation is not implemented.

How can I activate "simulation after change"?
   In the context menu of the :guilabel:`SIMULATE` button (by clicking it with the right mouse right button)
   you will find an option to activate :guilabel:`simulation after change`.

How can I activate "simulation after load"?
   In the context menu of the :guilabel:`SIMULATE` button (by clicking it with the right mouse button)
   you will find an option to activate :guilabel:`simulation after load`.

How can I activate "simulation after checkout"?
   When you go to another network version of the history, it automatically starts the simulation.
