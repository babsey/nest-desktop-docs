Project section
===============

The project section manages all project-related tasks.

Sidebar
*******

A click on the project switches to the project area.
If you are already in that area, this button toggles the list of projects,
a second sidebar.
In that list, you can manage your projects,
e.g create, rename, arrange or delete them.
More details can be found in the :ref:`usage guide <user/usage:manage projects>`.

Main content
************

In the project area, the main content consists of an area,
where you can switch between the network graph of the project,
the results of the simulation and the print view of the simulation results.
The slider in the top bar gives the possibility to switch between these views.
For the simulation results, there is also the possibility to switch between
2D and 3D representation, if the results have spatial properties.

The top bar contains the button to start the simulation.
A right click offers further options.
