Balanced network dynamics
=========================

Neurons communicate with other neurons in the central nervous system using both electrical and chemical signals depending on the transmitter system.

We measure the activity dynamics of two populations with different synaptic flavors. The population of excitatory neurons raises the overall activity whereas the other one of inhibitory neurons rather controls the dynamic state.
