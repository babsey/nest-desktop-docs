How to prepare a protocol of the course
=======================================

The course focuses on the function of synaptically coupled neuronal networks in the brain.
Step by step, simulation experiments will be performed of increasing complexity.
Students' task is then to document what they did, why they did it, and what came out of it, using precise language and appropriate terminology.
In addition, students will need to select and extract meaningful illustrations and parameter tables describing the simulation.

**How to achieve this?**

Simulations with NEST Desktop can be exported to *PDF*, *PNG* or *SVG* files.
for PDF export, students can increase the zoom factor of the browser before printing the page.
Image files can be imported to a document processor, e.g. LibreOffice or LaTeX for better illustration of the simulation.
It is important, however, that the writing is focused, and images to import to the protocol are carefully selected.
As a final step, the protocol will be exported to a single PDF file and submitted by email to tutors.

Generally, please make sure the protocol is concise, complete and correct.
For each assignment, students should separately address the following four aspects:

1. **What is the scientific question or problem that is addressed by the simulation?**
   Use correct terminology in descriptions.
   Keep neurobiological aspects and mathematical modeling concepts apart.
2. **Which exact simulation setup was used to answer this question?**
   List and describe all its components (e.g. neurons, devices), specify how they are connected together (e.g. electrodes, synapses),
   and provide tables of all relevant parameters.
   Default settings need to be stated at the beginning of each section.
   The goal is to make simulations fully reproducible.
3. **What was the outcome of the simulations performed?**
   A meaningful set of figures should be selected to underpin what could be the outcome of the simulations.
   In most cases, figures are helpful to illustrate text-based description of the role of a specific parameter for the behavior of the system in question (e.g. a neuron, a network).
4. **What are conclusions in view of the simulation results?**
   Based on the obtained simulation results, formulate an appropriate answer to the original questions.
   Distinguish aspects of biology and biophysics, and possible issues (e.g. shortcomings) of the numerical model.
