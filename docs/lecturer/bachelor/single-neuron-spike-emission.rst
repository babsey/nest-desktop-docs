Spike activity of an IAF neuron
===============================

IAF neuron models have two conditional states of activity, the sub-threshold and super-threshold.
Operating in sub-threshold activity regime neurons do not emit any spikes.

You can perform an extracellular recording using a spike recorder, which indicates the exact spike times.
An F-I curve (`I` is the measure for current, `F` for firing rate) is a common method to specify single neuron properties in rate coding.

Exercise
  1. Use a spike recorder to count spikes of a neuron.
  2. Characterize the neuron by an input-output curve that depicts the firing rate response as a function of the applied current.
  3. For the case of DC application to a LIF neuron, we can also analytically compute the input-output curve.
     Find a way to compare the curve measured via numerical simulation with the analytically computed curve.
     If there are any differences between these two curves, discuss where these could come from.
