Course design
=============


A course with NEST Desktop can be organized for the university students in different graduation levels.
The course can be held in a computer lab room or online where students can attend the course with their local machine.
For both options, NEST Desktop needs to be deployed in a virtual machine that students can use NEST Desktop via web browser.

It can be scheduled in a week block session with fixed times for brief lecture, tutorials and tutor hours.
The brief lecture provides complementary background information needed to understand the simulation assignments.
The tutorials give insight of functionalities of NEST Desktop needed for assignments.
The tutor hours gives tutors the opportunity to answer questions about the course assignments.
In addition, students can post their questions and comments by email to the teachers or tutors.
But students works on the course assignments alone or with a partner.

Example assignments are prepared here for students with different background knowledge.
