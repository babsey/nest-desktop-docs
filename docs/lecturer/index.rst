|lecturer| How to lecture with NEST Desktop
===========================================

.. warning::

   This is A PREVIEW. This guide is in development. Some information may be incomplete!


This section contains guides for the lecturer for teaching computational neuroscience with NEST Desktop.
With computer simulation students are able to explore models ranging from single neurons to large neuronal networks.
Numerical experiments of increasing complexity help to understand how brain networks function and what are the features of their dynamic behavior.

.. note::

  This section assumes that you have prior knowledge of the use of NEST Desktop.
  If you have not used NEST Desktop before, please read the User Documentation first (:doc:`/user/index`).

In term to organize a course guides are provides for coordinators:

  - :doc:`course-design`
  - :doc:`didactic-strategy`

Additionally, we provide course materials for the participants:

  - :doc:`first-steps`
  - :doc:`course-protocol`



These guides show how to systematically teach the biophysics of neurons, synapses and large networks of the brain to students with NEST Desktop. Video tutorials give insight of NEST Desktop in a course.
Also course materials will be handed out to students.


Select appropriate assignments that fits your background knowledge:
