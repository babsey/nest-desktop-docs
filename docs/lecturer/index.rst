|lecturer| How to lecture with NEST Desktop
===========================================

This section gives directions for lecturers who want to teach computational neuroscience with NEST Desktop.
Using computer simulations, students are able to explore models ranging from single neurons to large neuronal networks.
Numerical experiments of increasing complexity help to understand how brain networks function and what are the features of their dynamic behavior.

.. note::

  This section assumes that you have prior knowledge of how to use NEST Desktop.
  If you have not used NEST Desktop before, please read the User Documentation first (:doc:`/user/index`).

To support the organization of a course, we provide some hints for course instructors:

  - :doc:`course-design`
  - :doc:`didactic-concept`

Additionally, we provide course materials to be handed out to participants:

  - :doc:`first-steps`
  - :doc:`course-protocol`

This guide shows how you can teach the biophysics of neurons, synapses and large networks of the brain to students using NEST Desktop.
Video tutorials illustrate important aspects of the course work.
The provided material could be used to prepare handouts for students.

Select the level of the course that you plan to conduct with NEST Desktop:
