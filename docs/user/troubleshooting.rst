Troubleshootings
================

Having trouble getting something working? Got a question that the rest of our docs canâ€™t answer?
Maybe we can help with some answers to commonly asked questions and troublesome spots.


Error messages
--------------

**Server not found**

NEST Desktop cannot find the NEST Simulator.
It has two possible reasons:

  - NEST Desktop has a wrong URL under which it tries to contact the server. See the FAQ for NEST Simulator below.
  - The server is down. Contact the server operators and enter the URL of the NEST Simulator, e.g. ``localhost:5000`` in a web browser to check if it is running again.

.. note::
  For advanced users:
  Check in a terminal whether NEST Simulator is running (``curl localhost:5000``).


**Internal server error**

  It says that the back end (i.e, ``nest-server``) ended with an internal error.
  In this case, you have to monitor or debug the back end.

**NEST error**

  NEST Simulator produces a value error, e.g. ``The value cannot be negative.``.
  Please have a look at the official `NEST documentation <https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to obtain the correct syntax for the commads.
