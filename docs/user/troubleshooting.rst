Having trouble getting something working? Got a question that the rest of our docs canâ€™t answer?
Maybe we can help with some answers to commonly asked questions and troublesome spots.


Error messages
--------------

**Server not found**

NEST Desktop cannot find the NEST Server.
It has two possible reasons:

  - NEST Desktop has wrong URL of the server. See FAQ for NEST Server below.
  - The server is down. Enter the url of the NEST Server, e.g. ``localhost:5000`` in web browser.

.. note::
  For advanced users:
  Check in terminal whether NEST Server is running (``curl localhost:5000``).


**Internal server error**

  It says that the back end (i.e, ``nest-server``) ended with an internal error.
  In this case, you have to monitor or debug the back end.

**NEST error**

  NEST Simulator produces value error, e.g. ``The value cannot be negative.``.
