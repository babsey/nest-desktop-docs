Having trouble getting something working? Got a question that the rest of our docs canâ€™t answer?
Maybe we can help with some answers to commonly asked questions and troublesome spots.


Error messages
--------------

.. topic:: Server not found

  This error has two possible sources:
   - NEST Desktop has wrong URL of the server. See FAQ for NEST Server below.
   - The server is down. Enter the url of the NEST Server, e.g. ``localhost:5000`` in web browser.
     For advanced users: Check in terminal whether NEST Server is running (``curl localhost:5000``).


.. topic:: Internal server error

  NEST Simulator produces value error, e.g. ``The value cannot be negative.``.
