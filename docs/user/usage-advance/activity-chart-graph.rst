Activity chart graph
====================

The chart graph contains graphical panels organized in vertical stacks.
Chart panels are introduced specifically to explore the network activity by mouse interaction.
The simulation produces two different types of data sets.
Spike events contain times and sender ids whereas analog signals contain continuous quantities from the recording devices (:bdg:`voltmeter` or :bdg:`multimeter`).

By default, a line trace of membrane potential is displays.

Spike activity
--------------

   :target: #spike-activity

By default, a raster plot of the spike times as well as a time histogram of spikes is displayed.
