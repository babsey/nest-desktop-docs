Construct networks
==================

If you want to construct a network, you will have to open the network editor.
The network editor shows the network graph composing of nodes (shapes) and connections (lines).

Create nodes
------------

   :target: #create-nodes

In order to create a new node, you can click with the right mouse button in the network editor
and a `pie` panel with three letters appears to select an element type.
A node is divided into three element types:
stimulus (:bdg:`S`), recording (:bdg:`R`) device and neuron (:bdg:`N`).
Then it creates a node of the selected element type.

.. _usage-basic-connect-nodes:

Connect nodes
-------------

Forming a network of nodes is defined by making connections between and within nodes.
In order to connect nodes, you can click on a connector of a node,
then move the mouse towards anther node and finally click on a target node.
It creates a connection between source and target nodes.

.. hint::
   By pressing the hotkey :bdg:`ALT` and clicking a node at the same time,
   you enable the connecting mode or continue connecting other nodes.

.. _usage-basic-select-model-and-parameters:

Select model and parameters
---------------------------

   :target: #select-model-and-parameters
   :width: 320px

You are able to select the model of a node in the network controller.
Then it shows a list of parameters which you might want to work on.
Finally, you are able to change the values of visible parameters.
