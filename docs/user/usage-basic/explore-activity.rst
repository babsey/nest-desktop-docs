The network activity is composed of neuronal properties (positions and ids of neurons)
and recorded events from recording devices.
Events can be subdivided in two groups: spike events and analog signals.
Spike events contain times and ids of the senders emitting events to the recording devices
which can be considered as collectors (:bdg:`spike recorder`).
Analog signals contain continuous quantities from the recording devices
aka samplers (:bdg:`voltmeter` or :bdg:`multimeter`)
which query their targets at given time intervals.
Network activity can be explored in :doc:`Activity chart graph </user/usage-advance/activity-chart-graph>` (|chart-line| or |chart-scatter-plot|) :doc:`Activity animation graph </user/usage-advance/activity-animation-graph>` (|axis-arrow|), or :ref:`controller-sidebar-activity-statistics` (|stats|).
