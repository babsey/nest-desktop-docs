Usage guide with ViSimpl
========================

ViSimpl visualizes neural activity from brain simulation data,
i.e. it displays spike activity in space.
But it has better navigation interface and can be co-used with NEST Desktop.

For this approach, we need to simulate with Insite.
When you want to learn how to use NEST Desktop with Insite, please read :doc:`/user/usage-external/usage-with-insite`.
