**Trouble shootings**

Why cannot I find NEST Server?
  Sometimes the issue is resolved when you check NEST Server.

  If not, the problem lies in cookies and site data for the user authentication of the *EBRAINS*.
  That cookie expires after a session.
  This happens when you re-access to ``https://nest-desktop.apps.hbp.eu`` after the browser is closed.

  The simple solution is to reload the page (:guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`SHIFT` + :guilabel:`R`) that you can re-login.

  A persistent solution is to set the browser configuration that it deletes cookies and site data when the browser is closed (It works in Firefox).
