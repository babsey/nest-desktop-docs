Anaconda provides packages for `NEST Desktop <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/nest-desktop>`_. and `NEST Simulator
<https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/nest-simulator>`_. These packages can be installed with Conda (from
:bdg:`conda-forge`). Since NEST 3, the API server (i.e. :bdg:`NEST Server`) is included which is necessary for
:bdg:`NEST Desktop`.

Prequistion for conda-forge
---------------------------

`Conda-forge` is a collection of packages led by the community (https://conda-forge.org/). By default :bdg:`conda`
cannot install packages from the :bdg:`conda-forge`.

Add channel for :bdg:`conda-forge`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda config --add channels conda-forge
      conda config --set channel_priority strict

Install with Conda
------------------

#. Create a Conda environment called :bdg:`nest3` and install NEST Simulator:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n nest3 nest-simulator

#. Activate the Conda environment :bdg:`nest3`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate nest3

#. Install the dependencies for the API Server of NEST Simulator:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda install flask flask-cors RestrictedPython gunicorn

#. Install NEST Desktop

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda install nest-desktop


Start with Conda
----------------

#. Start NEST Server as the back end:

   The API Server for NEST Simulator is referred to as **NEST Server**.

   .. code-block:: bash

      nest-server start

   NEST Server is now running at http://localhost:52425.

.. note::
   Before you start `nest-server`, you have to export environment variables:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export NEST_SERVER_DISABLE_AUTH=1
      export NEST_SERVER_ENABLE_EXEC_CALL=1
      export NEST_SERVER_DISABLE_RESTRICTION=1

   For more information read the full documentation of NEST Server
   :doc:`here <nest-simulator:connect_nest/nest_server#set-environment-variables-for-security-options>`.

#. Start NEST Desktop (in another terminal session):

   .. code-block:: bash

      nest-desktop start

   NEST Desktop is now started and available in the web browser at http://localhost:54286.
