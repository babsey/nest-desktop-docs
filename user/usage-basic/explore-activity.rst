   The network activity is composed of neuronal properties (neuron positions and ids) and recorded events from
   recording devices. Events can be subdivided in two groups: spike events and analog signals. Spike events contain
   times and ids of the senders emitting events to the recording devices which can be considered as collectors
   (:bdg:`spike recorder`). Analog signals contain continuous quantities from the recording devices aka samplers
   (:bdg:`voltmeter` or :bdg:`multimeter`) which query their targets at given time intervals. Network activity can be
   explored in :doc:`Activity chart graph </user/usage-advanced/activity-chart-graph>` (|chart-line| or
   |chart-scatter-plot|) :doc:`Activity animation graph </user/usage-advanced/activity-animation-graph>` (|axis-arrow|),
   or :ref:`controller-sidebar-activity-statistics` (|stats|).
