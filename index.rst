      Hello there! :-)

      NEST Desktop is a web-based GUI application for NEST Simulator, an advanced simulation tool for the computational
      neuroscience.

      It's so great that you want to use NEST Desktop!

      You can watch :ref:`usage-basic-video-tutorial` or make :ref:`usage-basic-first-steps`.

The documentation is organized in four sections. Select the appropriate section that fits your needs:

.. grid:: 2
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item-card:: I am user
      :columns: 6
      :link: user-guide
      :link-type: ref

      .. grid:: 2
         :gutter: 2

         .. grid-item::
            :columns: 2

            |deployer|

         .. grid-item::
            :columns: 10

            The deployer learns how to set up NEST Desktop on a machine via the Python Package, Docker or Apptainer
            installation.

   .. grid-item-card:: I am developer
      :columns: 6
      :link: developer-guide
      :link-type: ref

      .. grid:: 2
         :gutter: 2

         .. grid-item::
            :columns: 2

            |developer|

         .. grid-item::
            :columns: 10

            The developer learns the source code architecture of NEST Desktop and how to contribute code or enhancements
            to the project.

.. note::
   On ReadTheDocs, it is possible to select versions of this documentation.
   These versions basically relate to the program versions (as found in the GitHub repository).
   This can be noticed when clicking on the "Edit on GitHub" text at the top right.

   Since the changes between patch level versions (e.g. 3.0.0 and 3.0.1) are usually not noticeable, we show a single
   branch for the recent minor version releases (e.g. '3.0' for all 3.0.x releases). This branch contains all patch
   releases and always points to the latest patch release of that release branch. Please keep this in mind when
   searching for information on a specific version of NEST Desktop!
