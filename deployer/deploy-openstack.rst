   :bdg:`Project` -> :bdg:`API Access` -> :bdg:`Download OpenStack RC File`

#. Source the RC file to login:

   .. code-block:: bash

      source Project_<userID>-openrc.sh

#. Modify the Ansible configurations in ``infrastructure/bwCloud/nest-desktop.json``.

   Set ``image_name``. Values for ``source_image`` and ``networks`` are taken from bwCloud dashboard.

#. Build an image on bwCloud:
